# DevSecOps Project 

The project aims to learn the modern DevSecOps approach, tools and methodologies. Using several tech stacks, the main direction is to test the code of an open-source application. Detecting, testing and fixing vulnerabilities, obsolescence and other vulnerabilities where applicable, all using GitHub Actions CI/CD tool.

## Learning through OWASP pygoat Project
The purpose is to give both developers and testers a platform for learning how to test applications and how to code securely. PyGoat is written in python and used Django web framework as a platform. It has both traditional web application vulnerabilities (i.e. XSS, SQLi) as well.


## Used stacks
* GitHub Actions
